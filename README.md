# Palindrome Permutation Assignment

## Problem Description

Write a function `palindrome_permutation(s: str) -> bool` in `student_code.py` that determines if a given string `s` is a permutation of a palindrome. A permutation of a palindrome is a string that can be rearranged to form a palindrome.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

### Examples of Palindromes:
- "racecar"
- "radar"
- "a man a plan a canal panama"

### Examples of Permutations of Palindromes:
- "Tact Coa" -> "taco cat" (spaces can be ignored)

### Examples of Non-Palindromes:
- "hello world"
- "this is not a palindrome permutation"

## Instructions

1. write your code in student_code.py and push it onto the root of yout repository
